# ExpenseInfo

This is a great ios app that helps the user to take a picture of the receipt and automatically pulls out the charges at the time of payment. And if the user loses a receipt then there is an option that allows to input charges directly from credit cards. Thus this will save userâ€™s time tracking down and manually recording spending history.
